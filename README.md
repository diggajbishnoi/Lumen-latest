## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi or local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anishsoni29/insight-ai
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   cd [repo-name]
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add the neccessary api keys to the config.py file, check config.example.py

4. Make an anaconda environment to save machine space while installing the dependencies.
   ```
   conda create -n test_env
   conda activate test_env
   ```

### Running the Full Application (Frontend + Backend)

To run the complete application with both frontend and backend:

1. Start the frontend:
   ```
   cd speech-interface
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the frontend at http://localhost:3000

2. In a new terminal, start the backend:
   ```
   python glasses.py
   ```

### Running Backend Only

If you only need to run the backend without the web interface:
```
python main.py
```

This will start the application in terminal mode, which will listen for the wake word and respond to speech commands.
